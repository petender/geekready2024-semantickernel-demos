By describing your existing code to AI models, they‚Äôll be called to address requests. When a request is made the model calls a function, and Semantic Kernel is the middleware translating the model's request to a function call and passes the results back to the model.\n",

    "> Next, the code imports a file called \"Settings.cs\" using the #!import directive. This file likely contains configuration settings for the AI backend used by the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The code then includes the necessary namespaces for working with the SemanticKernel library: Microsoft.SemanticKernel and Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Plugins.Core. These namespaces provide access to the classes and methods needed to create and configure the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "> After that, the code creates a builder object for the kernel using the Kernel.CreateBuilder() method. The builder is responsible for configuring the kernel and specifying the components it should use.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The code then loads the configuration settings from the \"Settings.cs\" file using the Settings.LoadFromFile() method. This method likely reads the settings from a file and returns them as a tuple containing the values for variables like useAzureOpenAI, model, azureEndpoint, apiKey, and orgId.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Next, the code checks the value of the useAzureOpenAI variable. If it is true, the code adds the Azure OpenAI chat completion component to the kernel using the builder.AddAzureOpenAIChatCompletion() method, passing in the appropriate parameters. If useAzureOpenAI is false, the code adds the regular OpenAI chat completion component using the builder.AddOpenAIChatCompletion() method.\n",

    "### 3. Semantic Kernel Plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "AI plugins act like a set of instructions or tasks that your application can execute. Think of them as an instructions book (John calls them recipes...) for your application, where each set of instructions (or recipes, or plugin) includes a list of ingredients (or functions) and steps (or triggers and actions) to accomplish a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, when you‚Äôre developing a chatbot that needs to answer travel-related questions, you could create a plugin with a function to fetch current travel data from a travel organization API and another function to format that data into a user-friendly message, HTML, table layout and alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugins are the core components of Semantic Kernel and can work seamlessly with plugins in ChatGPT, Bing, and Microsoft 365, as well as other third-party sources. They encapsulate capabilities into single units of functionality that the kernel can run. Plugins can include both native code and requests to AI services via prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugins are two-fold, allowing you to export them to ChatGPT, Bing or Microsoft 365. Similarly, plugins created for ChatGPT, Bing, and Microsoft 365 can be imported into Semantic Kernel effortlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Prompts**\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompts (or Prompt Functions) are the individual steps in a recipe. Each step (or function) tells your app what to do and how to achieve success when running it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, continuing on the travel chatbot idea, you might want it to be able to answer questions about the weather so you can plan your vacation trip. One of your prompts might be a step to decide on your preferred vacation location, based on flight cost from fetching an airline's API, followed by a step which collects the expected weather data from a weather API. Another prompt might be a step that combines the results of the flight options, together with the weather results and recommends the ultimate vacation spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompts are used in plugins, which are like the full recipes in your recipe book. Each plugin can contain multiple prompts and each prompt can be triggered by certain events or conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Functions** \n",
    "\n",
    "Native Functions in Semantic Kernel are similar to the handy-man or -woman's tools you use when doing construction work. These could be things like a saw, hammer, screwdrivers, drills and alike. They‚Äôre the tools that allow you to interact with your materials (data) and transform them in different ways (kitchen remodelling, building a house,...).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre building a chatbot and one of your instructions (plugins) is for creating furniture. One of your steps (Prompts) might be to collect different materials (wood, screws, doorhandles,...) together (combine data). While your hands can put everything together, you would also need a tool (Native Function) like a saw (to cut the panels), screwdriver (to screw everything together), etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you could create a Native Function that takes your instructions (data), uses the correct tool (performs an operation on the data) and returns a finished kitchen cupboard (the result of the operation)."

    "> The code starts by importing the necessary NuGet packages for the Microsoft Semantic Kernel library and its plugins. These packages provide the functionality for text embedding, chat completion, and image generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Next, the code imports a file called \"Settings.cs\" using the #!import directive. This file likely contains configuration settings for the OpenAI API, such as the endpoint, API key, and organization ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The code then imports the required namespaces for the Microsoft Semantic Kernel library and its plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A kernel builder object is created using the Kernel.CreateBuilder() method. The kernel builder is responsible for configuring the various AI features provided by the Semantic Kernel library.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The code checks a boolean variable useAzureOpenAI to determine whether to use the Azure implementation of the OpenAI API or the default implementation. Depending on the value of useAzureOpenAI, the code adds the appropriate AI services to the kernel builder. These services include text embedding generation, chat completion, and text-to-image generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> After configuring the AI services, the kernel builder is used to build the final kernel object.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The code retrieves instances of the text-to-image service and the text embedding generation service from the kernel. These instances will be used later to generate the image and extract embeddings from text, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The code then loads a plugin directory path and imports the plugin functions from that directory using the kernel.ImportPluginFromPromptDirectory() method. This allows the program to extend its functionality with custom plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The code sets up a KernelArguments object and adds an \"input\" argument with the value \"Belgium\". This argument will be passed to the semantic function invoked later.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The code invokes the semantic function named \"GuessWhat\" using the kernel.InvokeAsync() method. The function takes the previously defined arguments and returns a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The image description is extracted from the result using the GetValue<string>() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The image description is then passed to the dallE.GenerateImageAsync() method, which uses the DALL-E 3 model to generate an image. The method returns the URL of the generated image.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Utilities.ShowImage() method is called to display the generated image using the SkiaSharp library. The image is resized to 512x512 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Finally, the two lines of code at the end  print the image description and the URL of the generated image to the console.\n",

    "### 5. Planners \n",
    "\n",
    "[Semantic Kernel Planners](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/concepts/planning?pivots=programming-language-csharp) are a core component of the Semantic Kernel that provide AI orchestration. They manage the seamless integration between AI Models and Plugins by devising execution strategies from user requests. Essentially, planners determine which functions to call and in what order to fulfill a user‚Äôs request.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a user asks the AI to ‚Äútoggle all the lights,‚Äù the planner will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Call a function to get the current state of all lights.\n",
    "- Based on the state, call functions to change the state of each light accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This iterative process, where the AI can call a function, check the result, and then decide the next step, is known as function calling.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Comparison of Planners <> Plugins:\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "- *Planners:* Focus on orchestrating and managing the execution of multiple functions to achieve a complex task.\n",
    "- *Plugins:* Provide the actual functions that perform specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functionality:**\n",
    "- *Planners:* Determine which functions to call and in what sequence, based on user requests.\n",
    "- *Plugins:* Contain the functions that perform the tasks as directed by the planner.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Integration:**\n",
    "- *Planners:* Work at a higher level, coordinating the use of multiple plugins to fulfill user needs.\n",
    "- *Plugins:* Operate at a lower level, providing the building blocks (functions) that the planner uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, planners and plugins work together within the Semantic Kernel to provide a flexible and powerful way to handle complex user requests. Planners orchestrate the process, while plugins provide the necessary functionality to execute specific tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "What the code is doing:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> The selected code is a C# file named \"tempcode.cs\". Let's go through it step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "> First, there are some comments that provide information about the purpose of the code. It mentions that it is getting the latest package released on February 14th, 2024 from the NuGet package repository. The package being referenced is \"Microsoft.SemanticKernel\" with version 1.11.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Next, there are three lines starting with #r. These lines are known as \"reference directives\" and they are used to reference external assemblies or packages in C# code. In this case, the code is referencing three NuGet packages: \"Microsoft.SemanticKernel\", \"Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Plugins.Core\", and \"Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Planners.Handlebars\". The versions being referenced are 1.11.1, 1.11.1-alpha, and 1.11.1-preview respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "> After the reference directives, there is a line starting with #!import. This line is likely a custom directive specific to the project or framework being used. It is importing a file named \"Settings.cs\".\n",
    "\n",
    "> The using statements follow, which are used to import namespaces into the current code file. In this case, the code is importing namespaces related to the \"Microsoft.SemanticKernel\" package and its plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Next, a kernel builder object is created using the Kernel.CreateBuilder() method. The kernel builder is responsible for configuring and building the kernel, which is a central component of the \"Microsoft.SemanticKernel\" package.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The code then loads some settings from a file using the Settings.LoadFromFile() method. It retrieves values for variables such as useAzureOpenAI, model, azureEndpoint, apiKey, and orgId. These settings are used to configure the AI backend used by the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Based on the value of useAzureOpenAI, the code conditionally adds a chat completion plugin to the kernel builder. If useAzureOpenAI is true, it adds an Azure OpenAI chat completion plugin with the parameters \"gpt-4-default\", azureEndpoint, and apiKey. Otherwise, it adds an OpenAI chat completion plugin with the parameters model, apiKey, and orgId.\n",
    "\n",
    "> After that, there are several lines that add plugins to the kernel builder. The builder.Plugins.AddFromType<T>() method is used to add plugins based on their type. In this case, it adds plugins of type TimePlugin and ConversationSummaryPlugin. Additionally, the builder.Plugins.AddFromPromptDirectory() method is used to add plugins from specific directories. It adds plugins from the directories \"plugins/FoodPlugin\" and \"plugins/ShoppingPlugin\".\n",
    "\n",
    "> Overall, this code sets up the configuration for the \"Microsoft.SemanticKernel\" package by adding references, importing namespaces, creating a kernel builder, loading settings, and adding plugins to the builder. It demonstrates how to configure and customize the behavior of the kernel for specific AI tasks."
